# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This repo contains my course project to Coursera "Getting And Cleaning Data" course that is part of Data Science specialization.

There is just one script called run_analysis.R. It contains all functions and code to do the following:

    Download UCI HAR zip file to data dir
    Read data
    Do some transformations
    Write output data ("data_tidy") to a TXT file.

This repo also contains:
a) The CodeBook (CodeBook.md) that describes the variables of the output data.
b) The output data in "data_tidy.txt"
